						<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
						<p class="lead">At Children Are Unique Academy, we believe in creating positive developmental interactions between children and their surroundings.</p>
						<p><strong>The early years of childhood are the most influential in a child’s life.</strong><br>
							We believe that young children learn most effectively when they have opportunities to explore their surroundings and experience a variety of play. We offer a nurturing, dynamic and diverse environment that encourages a love of learning and connection with others.</p>

						<h1 class="my-5 text-center">A Brief History</h1>
						<p>Children Are Unique Academy was founded in 2017 by Annette Smoote and Sherri Cole, who believe that all children are unique no matter their race, ethnicity or gender. Both women had over 24 years of experience working with children, and so they used their combined skills to form and operate their own childcare center. Annette and Sherri wanted to create a place where parents knew their children would be safe and well taken care of. Today, Annette and Sherri are fully committed to running a top-quality daycare center and go above and beyond to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
